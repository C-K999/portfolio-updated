      <p>
        While I do have a bit of experience in Java, I plan on one day broaden
        my horizons by picking up a few more programming langauges here and
        there. Such as the mommonly used C++ and Python. Since I have an
        interest in game design, that is one of the many required seconary
        skills to pick up. Not to mention having to improve my own drawing as
        well. I vision myself one day helming my own big project with the
        variety of skills I have at my own disposal.
